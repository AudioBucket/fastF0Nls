Run file single_pitch for an example of using the compiled library
  ../lib/single_pitch.so

- Example:
  python single_pitch.py

- Import the module as

import single_pitch

- Possible calling sequence

import numpy as np
import single_pitch

N = 500
L = 15
pitch_bounds = np.array([0.01, 0.045])
F = 5*L*N
sp = single_pitch(L, F, N, pitch_bounds)
lnBFZeroOrder = 100.0

.... data in numpy array ....

omega_h = sp.est(data, lnBFZeroOrder)
